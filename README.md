# Webpack Starter Template
This is a basic starter template for setting up a webpack-based project. It includes configurations for development and production builds, as well as a development server with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled.

# Features
1. Webpack 5 configuration
2. Development and production build modes
3. Hot module replacement (HMR) for seamless development
4. CSS and asset loaders
5. HTML template generation with html-webpack-plugin
6. Source maps for easier debugging
7. Prettier for code formatting

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/webpack-starter-template.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   cd webpack-starter-template
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the webpack development server and open your application in the default browser. Any changes you make to the source files will be automatically reloaded in the browser thanks to HMR.
  
   Building for Production
   To create an optimized production build, run:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate a dist folder containing your optimized and minified production-ready files.

  Scripts
   * npm start: Start the webpack development server with HMR enabled
   * npm run build: Build the application for production
   * npm run watch: Watch for file changes and rebuild the application
   * npm run prettier: Format code with Prettier
